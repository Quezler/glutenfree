Aimed at modpacks and the people working on compatibility code for them.

With this you can scroll through the list to visibly confirm if the quality recipes look good or not.

(like good luck checking each quality recipe in every crafter to see if it indeed has quality or if something blocked it)

Usage: `/quality-recipes-inspector`
(this mod only checks recipes, not stuff like drills)

Legend:
- light grey: hidden
- green: recipe/entity supports quality
- red: recipe/entity has quality blocked
- orange: there is a discrepency between the recipe and the assemblers

Note: some internal recipe categories were hidden, such as recycling or voiding, check the code if you miss one.
