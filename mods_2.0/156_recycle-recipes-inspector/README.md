Aimed at modpacks and the people working on compatibility code for them.

With this you can scroll through the list to visibly confirm if the recycle recipes look good or not.

(like good luck checking each recycle result in factoriopedia to see if it picked the right recipe and was not updated later)

Usage: `/recycle-recipes-inspector`
(this mod assumes recycling recipes are named `<item name>-recycling`)
