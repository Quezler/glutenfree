> **welcome**
> to yet another of my unofficial side projects, this time to combine `Space Exploration (SE)` with `Space Age (SA)` and see what happens :eyes:

> **participating**
> 1) update to space exploration `0.7.43`
> 2) unzip the mod and edit the `info.json`
> 3) replace any `! quality` with `? quality`
> 4) replace any `! space-age` with `? space-age`

> **what to expect**
> 1) both universes are separate, you need to go through nauvis every time
> 2) space platforms and space ships can only exist within their own usual universe
> 3) resources have not been unified, both mods bring their own holmium for instance
> 4) you can freely bring items/buildings to the other universe, have fun with electromagnetic plants, foundries, antimatter reactors, etc
> 5) the tech trees are separate, space exploration does override a few things with space science automatically, but it should be playable
> 6) for it not to make much sense, i merely made the mods load together and fixed the scripting issues i could find, the rest is up to others
> 7) consider any space age content completely unofficial, in a future version anything about it could be changed or removed entirely in a whim
> 8) for me to like hearing about your experiences/suggestions/struggles in here as you are progressing, i appreciate interacting as a modder a lot
> 
> **compatibility**
> i guess it will work with some of the simpler planet mods, and people are free to make a mod that better balances the SESA tech/recipes/progression/etc

> **multiplayer**
> i have put together a little public server for everyone so we can playtest together, note that quality modules are disabled: `sesa.factorio.nydus.app`
> (some quality of life mods will undoubtedly get added to it over time, but mods that change content probably will not get in)

> well that's about it, have fun experimenting to see what cool new possibilities have opened up, and please keep all the SESA stuff in this thread ^-^
> (since it is completely unofficial)

Note that SESA can be played without this sesa mod, (required) changes have been made to Space Exploration in order to make it load and function,
optional changes however are done within this mod for the time being since this mod can update independently of the Space Exploration mod itself.
