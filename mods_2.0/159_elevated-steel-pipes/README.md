Example (yet fully functional) mod on how to add custom elevated pipe variations.

Usable with Krastorio 2 as well as with Krastorio 2 Spaced Out, and other forks with the right prototypes.

I am not entirely happy with the colors since it does not look as silver-y as the K2 ones, graphical contributions welcome.
