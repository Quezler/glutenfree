It always felt a bit wrong that nauvis had no imersite when playing with space exploration,
especially because of how much rocket trafic you need to ship any stage's products/ingredients.

This mod generates only single imersite veins, clusters are still unique to other planets,
but it should be enough to get started with before you scale up and can afford colonizing imersite.
