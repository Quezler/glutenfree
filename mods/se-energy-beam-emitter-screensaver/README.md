Doubleclick on the laser preview window to ride it. (no you cannot actually steer it)

You'll also need to zoom in a bit by yourself in order to trigger the chunk to chart.

Thumbnail originates from the https://t.me/addstickers/Skavenzepto sticker pack on telegram.

Future version: perhaps just teleporting the remote view around each tick for each charting and no need for double clicking.

(and there will probably be issue reports that when the beam teleports far away that the link breaks, i'll fix the bugs as they'll come)
